The main task here is to visualize the earthquake data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). I used Leaflet with JavaScript to accomplish this. 

### Step 1
[Leaflet Step 1](https://esalgado28.github.io/leaflet-challenge/Leaflet-Step-1/)

In the first step, circle markers representing the earthquakes were added onto a basic map layer. The marker size corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake and the color represents the depth. A legend is included in the bottom right. Clicking the markers displays additional details as well. The source files can be found under */Leaflet-Step-1*.

### Step 2
[Leaflet Step 2](https://esalgado28.github.io/leaflet-challenge/Leaflet-Step-2/)

Next, tectonic plate geoJSON data from <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates> was used to add an additional layer to the map. Other base layers were added as well, along with a control that allows the user to switch between base layers and toggle the overlays on/off. The source files can be found under */Leaflet-Step-2*
